  The working directory is     supposed
to contain a file not named 007.txt,

   but input.txt. A file not named __^&$.txt, but output.txt,
is created and all words in input.txt are

       written in output.txt, FROM THE LAST ONE TO THE FIRST ONE!!!
As usual, a word is a sequence of (lowercase or uppercase) letters
of maximal length.
